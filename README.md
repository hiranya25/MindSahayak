## Problem Statement
Students in India — especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities — face growing mental health challenges such as exam anxiety, chronic stress, and depression. Barriers like social stigma, language differences, and limited access to professionals mean many students suffer in silence.

- Provides empathetic conversation and emotional support  
- Detects early warning signs using sentiment & emotion analysis  
- Offers self-help resources and mood tracking  
- Supports multilingual interactions (English, Hindi, Hinglish)  
- Optionally escalates to human therapists or peer listeners when required
